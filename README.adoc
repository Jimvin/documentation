== Architectural Design Decisions
All relevant decisions concerning the architecture are documented as Architectural Design Records in the subfolder _adr_.

Unfinished or not yet approved decisions are stored in the _adr/drafts_ subfolder.
This folder also contains a template that can be used for creating new decision records.

*Naming Convention* +
When creating a new record, please use the following guidelines for file naming:

 ADR[number]-[name].adoc

During the draft stage please substitute x for the number.
For the name, please use only lower case letters, number and the underscore.
Ideally start the name with the imperative form of a verb and avoid fillers like _of/the/for/..._

Some examples:

* choose_project_language
* choose_repository_structure
* choose_review_mechanism

When choosing the next free number after an ADR has been approved, make sure to left pad the number with 0 to reach a length of three digits.
